Programming the AT Client sample
================================

To configure the sample and to program the AT Client sample, complete the following steps:

1. Make the sample programmable to multiple devices by removing all hard coded credentials. This can be done by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK <CONFIG_APP_LWM2M_PSK>` Kconfig option to empty value.
#. Enable bootstrapping using the configuration overlay file :file:`overlay-avsystem-bootstrap.conf`. Bootstrapping is required for an LwM2M client to rotate security credentials.
#. Prepare the production script or steps for your nRF9160-based device.
#. Store the bootstrap credentials for the security tag that you have specified in |bootstrap_kconfig| Kconfig option into the nRF9160 modem.
#. Program the :ref:`at_client_sample` sample to your device to control the security tags in the modem.
